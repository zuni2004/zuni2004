👋 Hi, I’m @zuni2004

👩‍💻 I’m Zunaira Abdul Aziz, a 3rd year BSSE student at ITU

👀 I’m interested in cooking, studying, and coding

💼 Currently building web applications with an Embassy. I’m working on the backend — building OCR systems, routers, and exploring real-world applications of machine learning

🧠 Currently learning and working with new tech stacks like FastAPI, and diving deeper into machine learning

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting tech or food-related projects :p

📫 How to reach me: zunairaabdulaziz@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: If I weren’t a Software Engineering student, I’d be studying culinary arts and opening my own restaurant. I love creating—whether it’s in code or in the kitchen. Life can be stressful, but hey, what is life without a little chaos? ;)
